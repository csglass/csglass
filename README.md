- 👀 I’m interested in design, photography and finding meaningful patterns in life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what plants are appropriate for the season and how to make complex components in Figma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps folks and communinities coexist and lead meaningful lives.
